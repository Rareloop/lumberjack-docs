# Configuration

Lumberjack comes with a selection of config files out-of-the-box. These live in the `config/` directory and are simple `.php` files that return an `array`.

## Accessing Configuration Values

Let's take a look at `config/app.php`:

```php
return [
    /**
     * The current application environment
     */
    'environment' => getenv('WP_ENV'),

    // ...etc
];
```

Here we are proxying an environment variable defined in the `.env` file that Bedrock provides. We'd recommend following this pattern, where you should only see `getenv` called in your config files.

You can easily access the environment variable using the `Rareloop\Lumberjack\Facades\Config` facade.

```php
use Rareloop\Lumberjack\Facades\Config;

$env = Config::get('app.environment');
```

You can provide a default value too, incase the configuration option does not exist.

```php
$env = Config::get('app.environment', 'production');
```

If you need to update a config option, you can use the `set` method, like so:

```php
Config::set('app.debug', false);
```

You can check whether an item exists in the config:

```php
if (Config::has('app.mySetting') {
    // ...
}
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note that the `has` method only checks whether the config item exists, regardless of its value**. 

If you set `app.mySetting` to an empty value such as `false` or `null`, `has('app.mySetting')` will return `true`.
{% endhint %}

## Adding your own config files

Chances are, you're going to need to add your own config files at some point. All you need to do is create a new `.php` file in the `config/` directory, and have it return an array.

This works because Lumberjack will look for all files in the `config/` directory that have a `.php` extension and automatically registers all the data to the application's config.
